A pointer is just an address â€” a way to point to where something lives in memory.

Think of it like this:

You live in a house. Your house has an address. If someone knows your address, they can visit you and change your furniture.
A pointer is that address.

x := 10        // x is a value
p := &x        // p is a pointer TO x (use & to get address)

*p = 20        // change the value of x using the pointer
fmt.Println(x) // 20
